### Vitamin detector

You can buy a vitamin detector in the store for 74. It works like a juice radar: the closer you are to a juice, the greener its color.

You can add the [ReservedVitaminDetectorSlot](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Shlygly/ReservedVitaminDetectorSlot/) mod to have a reserved slot for it.

### Juice blender

The juice blender is a furniture you can buy in the store to earn more money by combining juices.
Up to 4 juices can be combined to create a *Plindfruy* multi-fruit juice.

The price of a multi-fruit juice is the sum of the juices that have been combined, multiplied by a value defined by the format of the juices used (specified above).
If different juice formats are used in the same mix, the smallest multiplier is used.

If the juice blender is not completely filled (4 juices), the multiplier is reduced.

### Neons

You can buy neons furniture to decorate your ship with your favorite juices brands. What's special about them is that they're on the outside of the ship !

Here are all the neons available :
 - **Sapik Neon** : cost 24 ![Sapik neon screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Shlygly/LethalCompanyJuicesMod/main/_doc-resources/furniture-neon-sapik.png)

## Why ?

Actually, it's just a stupid french private joke with friends, there's nothing to understand except puns on juices names... That's why it was essential to create this mod !
